# ABOUT DOOBLE
Dooble provides two individuals with the means to determine who is the better artist. This Android application allows the two players to draw pictures according to a prompt under no time limit. The game serves to entertain groups of friends who are looking for ways to compete in a friendly manner, show off their artistic talents, and exercise their creative muscles. 

The game’s home screen has two options: create and join game. Create game allows one person to start a game and connect to two other Android phones, while join game allows a person to become a “player” and join someone’s game. A list of discoverable devices will be displayed as a list of MAC addresses/phone model names, and the players can then select each other. After they select each other, the host and each of the players will be paired together. For clarification, this means that the host is paired with both players, but the players are not paired with each other.  

The host is then able to type in a designated drawing topic, and click start game. The two players will be brought to the Drawing Studio screen, where they have a white canvas to draw their pictures on. There are twelve colors to choose from, and three different brush thickness sizes. The players also have an access to the Eraser tool, which allows them to erase their mistakes. 

After both players are done with their doodles, the host is able to make a choice on which picture was better. He/she will select that picture, and the score for the winner will be incremented. Between rounds, the score will be kept. Players may use the app for as many rounds as they like.
